Everyone here understands the tradeoff:  there is an inherent tension between 
promoting freedom by building a protective wall around our city, and promoting 
freedom by interoperating with non-free environments so that people in those 
environments have a chance to experience freedom.  Historically, the FSF has 
used both strategies -- so you, too, understand this tradeoff.

I will try to find out more about these refactoring practices --
privately, with people I have confidence in, that have no axe to
grind ( advocate somthing for the benefits of oneself)


LLVM is a real technical step forward, yoked to a step backward in
defending our freedom.  If it were just the former, I would be
enthusiastic for it.  However, the latter is more important, so we
must do our best to resist it, even temporarily


LLVM is free software.  It is undefended by copyleft, ideal for Apple
to make it proprietary.  That's why it is a big step backwards.
Nonetheless the version that the researchers work on is free.

at some point of time we draw a
line of where we try exerting control over what people use tools for

clang/LLVM also provide a very friendly set of libraries to make it
easy for people to go in, walk the AST, pattern match on it, refactor
it, etc. -- the tools are being used extensively in industry for
refactoring support

The GPL was RMS's greatest hack , but copyleft is just one tool. It 
can promote software sharing, but it can't bend the world to RMS's will.

Leave the politics behind. "We reject kings, presidents and voting. We
believe in rough consensus and running code".
